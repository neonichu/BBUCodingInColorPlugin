# BBUCodingInColorPlugin

[Kolin Krewinkel][4] did a great job implementing this idea in [Polychromatic][3]. This repository is just here for historical purposes.

__This is work in progress, do not use it in this stage.__

An Xcode plugin which implements the ideas from the 
[Coding In Color article][2] by Evan Brooks.
